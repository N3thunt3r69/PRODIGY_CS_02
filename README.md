# PRODIGY_CS_02
This program is an image encryption and decryption program that uses the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm. 
This program accepts a 16-character (128-bit) key for encryption as input (encryption key). Additionally, I added error handling features to ensure that the key is of the correct length. If not, an error message is displayed. It incorporates a number of modules for its successful implementation.
